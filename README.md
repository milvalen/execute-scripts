# execute-scripts

This script is designed to execute all Python scripts stored in a given folder (by default in the `scripts` folder). Each script executes sequentially a `.py` file in a folder, displaying progress information to the console. If an error occurs during the execution of any script, the script continues to execute the remaining files, displaying an error message and a traceback.
