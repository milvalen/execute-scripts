### Execute Scripts

This Python script is designed to execute all Python scripts (`.py` files) located in a specified directory. It suppresses the output of the scripts and only displays a summary of execution results and errors. The script handles exceptions gracefully, showing only the most relevant part of the traceback for errors.
